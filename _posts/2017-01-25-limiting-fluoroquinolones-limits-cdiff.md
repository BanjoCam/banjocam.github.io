[Curbing Antibiotics Tied to Britain's Drop in C. Diff](http://www.medpagetoday.com/Gastroenterology/GeneralGastroenterology/62719?isalert=1&uun=gd5436R7509844u&xid=NL_breakingnews_2017-01-25)

This looked at the impact of fluoroquinolone prescribing restriction in Britain and found a reduction in C. Diff occurrance as well as 
fluoroquinolone resistant organisms. Generally antibiotic rotation is not recommended as a stewardship intervention
but there seem to be ever more [reasons](http://healthycanadians.gc.ca/recall-alert-rappel-avis/hc-sc/2017/61900a-eng.php) to
move away from prescribing FQs first line in general.  

Thankfully we don't have a high rate of nosocomial c diff at my institution but anecdotally I have not
noticed a particular increased incidence secondary to any particular antibiotic or antibiotic class. 
Interestingly if you delve into the full paper, it mentions:  

> Hospital cephalosporin and fluoroquinolone prescribing were also positively associated with incidence of C difficile infection (CC=0·73, 0·15 to 0·86, and 0·62, −0·09 to 0·81; appendix), but associations were estimated much less precisely given the much smaller population (approximately 1% of England). Positive associations were also observed between C difficile infection decline and decline in extended spectrum penicillins (0·84, 0·24 to 0·90) and beta-lactamase-resistant penicillins (0·67, −0·04 to 0·81; appendix). 

The paper was only fully powered it seems for fluoroquinolones because their prescribing was actually restricted - 
so they could correlate the reduction in FQ-resistance (secondary to the reduction in use) with the
reduction in c-diff.  

Conclusion? I'm still not sure which abx are the _worst_ for causing c diff (surely you would even
need to specific specific cephalosporins rather than the whole class??) so I'll stick to my current
principle, which is try to use less of all antibiotics in the first place.
