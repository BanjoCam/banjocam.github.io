title: "Visualizing Bacterial Evolution"

I usually think of a "mega-plate" as what I end up with when I go to the
buffet...

Saw this on my Google Now feed this morning. The video shows a pretty neat way
to visualize bacterial resistance. When we call something "resistant" in
clinical terms, we're referencing breakpoints that correspond to a safe dose in
humans. In this experiment, the bacteria became resistant to 1000x concentrated
antibiotics... way higher than any dose you could give a human. Pretty
terrifying.
