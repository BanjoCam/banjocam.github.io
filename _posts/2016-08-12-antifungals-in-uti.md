I am currently working on a proposal to switch our main formulary echinocandin
to Micafungin for cost & simplicity purposes (no loading dose as compared to
caspo), working on an "approved indications" for both meds. I'm under the
impression that neither option is recommended for treatment of UTI, but I
have never actually substantiated this. Let's see what we can find.

[_Candida_ Urinary Tract Infections - Treatment](http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/52/suppl_6/S457.full)  
_Clinical Infectious Diseases, 2011_  

- most lab reports of candiduria represent colonization or procurement
contamination (_often these are good ASP opportunities as they are treated for
no reason_)
- fluconazole is preferred as a _candida_ treatment in urine as it concentrates
well (as unchanged drug; highly water soluble; 10-fold times the plasma level!), possibly even as compared to other azoles
    - itra/vori/posa have terrible urine concentration
    - article lists flucytosine PO as a valid alternative despite high side effects
    (concentrates well in urine), but does not appear to be available in Canada
    - amphoB concentrates well, can also do bladder irrigation
- search for predisposing factors when you find candiduria, because you can
find things like DM, GU structural abnormalities, deminished renal function...
that you wouldn't have otherwise found!
- watch out with asymptomatic candiduria in hospitalized patients, in case they
are at risk of it going systemic. Change the catheter!
- _glabrata_ and _krusei_ are more likely to be fluc resistant
- AmphoB _candida_ resistance is rare, esp in _albicans_
    - pilot studies show potential for single 1mg/kg dose that will lead to
    urine concentrations > MIC for days to months post dose!
    - lipid amphoB are less nephrotoxic but concentrate worse in urine.
    potential for tx failure
    - high relapse after bladder irrigation method, generally don't use it
- the drugs that concentrate poorly in urine may do better for pyelo due to
increased renal concentrations, but fluc is still preferred
- use at least 400mg of fluc __regardless of renal failure__. hmm.
- so, turns out this article actually doesn't mention the echinocandins beyond
the fact that their role is unclear due to their poor urine contentrations. Oh
well, I learned a lot anyway. Will be a good reference to come back to for
details on specific GU infections (I didn't go into the prostatitis section,
for example)

[Treatment of candiduria with micafungin: A case series](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2533538/)  
_Canadian Journal of Infectious Diseases and Medical Microbiology, 2007_  

- _glabrata_ UTI increasing in frequency, can be seen in patients who've
received fluconazole
- 3 cases of successful UTI tx (fluc resistant _albicans_, _glabrata_,
_glabrata_ again)
- echinocandins are less active against _parapsilosis_ ?

[A case of _Candida glabrata_ severe urinary sepsis successfully treated with micafungin](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211753914000128)  
_Medical Mycology Case Reports, 2014_  

- Pt with fluc-resistant _glabrata_ in patient also with advanced renal failure
- 20% chance of _glabrata_ (50-70% chance of _albicans_)
- Micafungin clearance is not affected by renal dysfunction, so it is safe to
use in renal failure (especially compared to fluc, amphoB, etc!)
- all echinocandins have poor glomerular filtration and tubular secretion =
poor urine concentration (think I've figured that out by now)
    - therefore, use has historically been avoided in UTI
- still probably has excellent tissue penetration - including kidneys
- treated patient with 200 mg daily of micafungin, double the usual dose.
Trying to achieve higher renal concentration. No adverse effects were seen
    - this dose is formally indicated for invasive candidiasis not responding to
    standard dosing
    - pt also had hypoalbuminemia; would have had more free serum micafungin,
    possibly contributing to the treatment success

The 2016 IDSA guidelines for Candiduria do not recommend echinocandins, amphoB
is preferred (non-liposomal, 1-7 days!). They may work if upper infection is
suspected, but are still last-line. There are mentions of case reports of
treatment failures for _glabrata_ UTI.

My take-away: we should be preferentially using amphoB (non-liposomal) for
symptomatic candiduria when fluconazole is not a valid option for whatever
reason. Will definitely not be putting UTI on the recommended
indications list for caspo/mica.

_Linking those amphoB dosing studies here for future reference (not super
relevant for this research)_
