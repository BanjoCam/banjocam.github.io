[Use of antibiotics during pregnancy and risk of spontaneous abortion - CMAJ](http://www.cmaj.ca/content/189/17/E625.full)

Interesting outcomes - we already don't use tetracyclines and quinolones in pregnancy, so the miscarriage
risk is not too relevant for those. I was surprised about macrolides being higher risk. Nitrofurantoin
is fine, which I did not find surprising given its does not have good distribution anywhere but bladder.  

Septra also has a higher risk, and it is recommended a second line tx for UTI in pregnancy, so that 
may need reassessed. However, the guidelines also stipulate avoiding use in first trimester due to
the potential for fetal abnormalities (not miscarriage, but as with tetracyclines/quinolones, you
are already avoiding its use). Given the study focused on 20 weeks and earlier, it looks like
not much needs changing in current practice, except maybe the use of macrolides.
