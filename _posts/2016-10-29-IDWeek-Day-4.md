## Antibiotic Dosing in Special Populations ##

**Critically Ill**

***

- abx dosing more difficult because you're not just trying to exert pharmadynamic effects on the patient, you are actually targetting the pathogen
	- more difficult to monitor than, say, blood pressure
- plasma concentrations are surrogates, and not always a great representation of tissue
- Vanco was rushed through clinical development, 2gm/day was considered "effective and minimally toxic" (1958)
- cefotaxime breakpoints was originally decided based on peaks except it's not a concentration dependent drug
- polymixin B - CrCl dependent dosing but it's not elminated renally
- hydrophilic abx: lower Vd, mostly renally cleared, low intracellular penetration
- lipophilic: higher Vd, mostly hepatically cleared, good intracellular penetration
	- see slide for some examples
- changes in critically ill:
	- imparied absorpation -> decreased AUc
	- capillary leak -> increased Vd,. decreased plasma concentration, delyayed distribution
	- end-organ damage -> decreasee clearance, increased AUC
		- pharmacists good at lowering dose of drug, but generally less good at bumping doses when appropriate.
	- hypoalbuminemia: increased free fraction, variable effects
		- only imporant for protein-bound drugs
	- augmented clearance -> decreased AUC and drug exposure
- Roberts JA. Clin Pharmacokinet 2006;; Udy AA clin pharmacokinet 2010; Uildemolis M; CHEST 2011
	- see slide in the lecture; shows common changes for different critically ill states
- Augmented renal clearance
	- GFR >150, 160 (different definitions)
	- caused by a variety of fators in multiple states (eg sepsis, trauma) has increased cardiac output; we add fluid and pressors, things get pushed through quickly
	- no renal dosing guidelines for things like CrCl 150
	- Current formulas available for CrCl are terrible at calculating augmented. _Baptista JP Critical Care 2011_
		- Cockcroft gault was actually the best, but all were a severe underestimate
- Roberts JA et al In J Antimicrob Agents 2010: 
	- 30 bed ICu over 11 months, adjuted abxx based on twice weekly stead state troughs
	- had to increase doses 50% of the time from the initial doses physicians were ordering
	- 72% did not achieve target endpoints
- DALI study: defining antibiotic levels in intensive care patients
	- Roberts JA et al Clin Infect Dis 2014
	- large study doing similar to the last one but with multicenter and way more patients
	- up to 500 fold difference in unbound concentrations of abx at both sampling points
	- 16% did not achieve target and this was associated with clinical failure
- summary: Roberts JA, Lipman J. Clin Pharmacokinet 2006 (table in slides)
- should probably be loading patients when they have an increased Vd

**Obesity**

***

- increased failures: low relative dosing or effects of obesity itself?
- antibiotic use in early age is associated with obesity due to changes in the microbiome
- absorption - not significantly modified
- distribution: hydrophilic drugs should not be reatly incluenced as only 5% of cardiac output is blood flow into fat (maxes out)
- Vd increases generally occurs
- Metabolism: changes not well defined in obesity
- Elimination: higher glommerular planar surface area
- Pk effects of obesity are hard to predict in infected, ill patients
	- sometimes decreases likelyhood of target attainment but sometimes increases it too (depends on drug)

**CRRT**

***

- a lot of dosing literature is out of date due to improvments in CRRT machines etc; we underdose a lot of drugs
- Hemofiltration -> Convection
	- activvel removal of solutes and drugs by pump-drive pressure gradient
	- higher propensity to remove larger drugs
	- independent of concentration gradients or molecular drugs
	- Sieving coefficeint can be helpful if you have it
- Hemodialysis -> diffusion
	- Passive moment of substances down concentration gradients across semipermiable membrane
- CVVH = convection, CVVHD mostly diffiusion (little convection), CVVHDF = lots of both => more drug removed than expected
- Dose of CRRT -> factors effluent flow and duration of CRRt; most important variable
- Blood flow rate and surface area of the filter have low impact on drug concentration
- Filter material: where sieving coeffecient comes into play
- Protein binding -> only unbound drug removed by CRRt
- increase in Vd in CRRT: larger loading dose needed, but decreased efficacy of CRRT removal
- Heintz BH. Pharmacotherapy 2009: amazing reference paper
- Beumier M, Crit care 2014: looked at _non_ renal dose adjusted abx in CRRT patients
	- only 10% proportion of inadequate concentrations
	- trade off, 53% had very high levels
	- how do we know what an actual toxic level is for a beta lactam? they tend to be relatively safe agents in terms of dose related toxicity so aiming for efficacy targets may be more appropriate
- most CRRT dose studies assume 1-2L/hr and minimal residual function; check on your patients, often it's running more like 2-3 L/hr and pt may have some residual renal function
- consider loading doses! esp in drugs we know will be cleared well (like low protein bound etc) and possibly more aggressive maintenance doses
- moving target: CRRT is constantly changing (like while a patient is on it), need to constantly reassessing the dose adjustments 

**Strategies**

***

- Individualized dosing, determined by physiological characteristics that may affect PK
- Scaglione F et al Eur Respir J 2009: Pk/PD optimization on the patient level in HAP
	- real time TDR for several abx, made dose adjustments in ~40% of the patients in the study (pts were underdosed)
	- pts who got the adjustments had better clinical and microbiological outcomes
- Roberts JA lancet infect Dis 2014: Bayesian calculations
- Presenters do not recommend dose capping for vanco; will use 2-2.5 g loading doses (sometimes divided LD strategies) and one has gone up to 6g daily for vanco
- Also do not dose cap for daptomycin (use TBW)
- recommended max is 600 q8h for ceftaroline but have used 900 for 450lb pt
