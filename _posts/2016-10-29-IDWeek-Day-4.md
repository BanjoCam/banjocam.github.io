## Antibiotic Dosing in Special Populations ##

*Critically Ill*
***

- abx dosing more difficult because you're not just trying to exert pharmadynamic effects on the patient, you are actually targetting the pathogen
	- more difficult to monitor than, say, blood pressure
- plasma concentrations are surrogates, and not always a great representation of tissue
- Vanco was rushed through clinical development, 2gm/day was considered "effective and minimally toxic" (1958)
- cefotaxime breakpoints was originally decided based on peaks except it's not a concentration dependent drug
- polymixin B - CrCl dependent dosing but it's not elminated renally
- hydrophilic abx: lower Vd, mostly renally cleared, low intracellular penetration
- lipophilic: higher Vd, mostly hepatically cleared, good intracellular penetration
	- see slide for some examples
- changes in critically ill:
	- imparied absorpation -> decreased AUc
	- capillary leak -> increased Vd,. decreased plasma concentration, delyayed distribution
	- end-organ damage -> decreasee clearance, increased AUC
		- pharmacists good at lowering dose of drug, but generally less good at bumping doses when appropriate.
	- hypoalbuminemia: increased free fraction, variable effects
		- only imporant for protein-bound drugs
	- augmented clearance -> decreased AUC and drug exposure
- Roberts JA. Clin Pharmacokinet 2006;; Udy AA clin pharmacokinet 2010; Uildemolis M; CHEST 2011
	- see slide in the lecture; shows common changes for different critically ill states
- Augmented renal clearance
	- GFR >150, 160 (different definitions)
	- caused by a variety of fators in multiple states (eg sepsis, trauma) has increased cardiac output; we add fluid and pressors, things get pushed through quickly
	- no renal dosing guidelines for things like CrCl 150
	- Current formulas available for CrCl are terrible at calculating augmented. _Baptista JP Critical Care 2011_
		- Cockcroft gault was actually the best, but all were a severe underestimate
- Roberts JA et al In J Antimicrob Agents 2010: 
	- 30 bed ICu over 11 months, adjuted abxx based on twice weekly stead state troughs
	- had to increase doses 50% of the time from the initial doses physicians were ordering
	- 72% did not achieve target endpoints
- DALI study: defining antibiotic levels in intensive care patients
	- Roberts JA et al Clin Infect Dis 2014
	- large study doing similar to the last one but with multicenter and way more patients
	- up to 500 fold difference in unbound concentrations of abx at both sampling points
	- 16% did not achieve target and this was associated with clinical failure
- summary: Roberts JA, Lipman J. Clin Pharmacokinet 2006 (table in slides)
- should probably be loading patients when they have an increased Vd

*Obesity*
***

- increased failures: low relative dosing or effects of obesity itself?
- antibiotic use in early age is associated with obesity due to changes in the microbiome
- absorption - not significantly modified
- distribution: hydrophilic drugs should not be reatly incluenced as only 5% of cardiac output is blood flow into fat (maxes out)
- Vd increases generally occurs
- Metabolism: changes not well defined in obesity
- Elimination: higher glommerular planar surface area
