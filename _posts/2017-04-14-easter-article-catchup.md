Been far too long since a post - here are some brief summaries of articles or posts that I found interesting.

[FDA Okays First Tardive Dyskinesia Drug](http://www.medpagetoday.com/neurology/generalneurology/64513?xid=nl_mpt_DHE_2017-04-14&eun=g1123932d0r&pos=6)

- VMAT2 inhibitor (vesicular monoamine 2 transporter - a dopamine regulating pathway) 
- valbenazine (Ingrezza)
- another QT prolonging agent for people already taking QT prolonging agents... awesome!
- improves severity of involuntary movements
- another VMAT2 approved recently: deutetrabenazine, but for Huntington's chorea. Would be suprised if they also didn't try for a TD indication too though. (Also... TEVA makes novel drugs?)

[Canadians with cystic fibrosis have a significant survival advantage over American patients](http://www.2minutemedicine.com/canadians-with-cystic-fibrosis-have-a-significant-survival-advantage-over-american-patients/)

- Public healthcare can have its disadvantages, but I would take it over the US's model any day.
> While adjusting for all other risk factors did not change the differences observed in patient outcome between countries, differences in survival did vary depending on U.S. patientsâ€™ private insurance status.

['Virtual' Management Improves In-Hospital Glucose Control](http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/877721)

- Took a few searches to figure out what a virtual glucose management service is, but essentially it looks like an algorithm built into the EMR that detects uncontrolled blood glucose
- Helped prevent consecutive high glucose readings; basically physicians can lock things down sooner
- Looks like it'll need far more research to determine if it's really cost effective but it's a cool idea nonetheless

[Extended rivaroxaban superior to aspirin in lowering risk of recurrent venous thromboembolism: The EINSTEIN CHOICE trial](http://www.2minutemedicine.com/extended-rivaroxaban-superior-to-aspirin-in-lowering-risk-of-recurrent-venous-thromboembolism-the-einstein-choice-trial/)

- Compared xarelto 10mg daily, 20mg daily, and ASA 100mg for VTE prophylaxis in patients with previous clot
- 10mg did have efficacy with a small bleed risk, but the trial is sponsored by a drug company
    - Compared against ASA, which IS recommended in long term prophylaxis once anticoagulation is stopped... still not sure it's a fair comparitor. Anticoagulants SHOULD be more effective than ASA. I guess they're trying to get the guidelines changed to low dose NOAC instead.

[Continuous Proton Pump Inhibitor Therapy and the Associated Risk of Recurrent Clostridium difficile Infection](http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2173095?issueno=5&quiz=1&accessHash=AB65740118B91E95BD61733C55C1AAB137896566)

- Very relevant paper for my practice, as we review every active _C. difficile_ case in the hospital
- It is (anecdotally) difficult to corroborate PPI with risk of first _C. diff_ incidence, as so many patients are already on PPI; but we are never sure if it is worth tapering PPI to lower recurrence risk
- This meta-analysis looked at CDI recurrence 15-90 days post initial episode, and did find an elevated risk of recurrence in the patients receiving PPIs (60.7% of patients looked at were on PPI)
    - Interesting: only 47.1% of the patients on PPI had an evidence-based indication
- Often, the hardest part about stopping a PPI (esp in elderly patients) is that you have no idea why they were on it to begin with and what will happen if you stop it
    - As well, they will be experiencing GI symptoms with the _C. diff_ and it may be hard to tell if stopping the PPI is also having a negative effect.
