Had to return the iPad so these notes were taken by hand. Trying to read my writing and get them up on the site.

## Distinguishing Asymptomatic Bacteruria

- Awesome slide on how cool ASP pharmacists are. Need to get a screengrab!
- List of TRUE signs and symptoms of CaUTI from IDSA: 
    - some shouldn't really be on their list including cloudy/foul smelling urine, sediment, and another one I missed
- studies range from 30-80% treatment of asymptomatic bacteruria, many unnecessary cultures
- early asymptomatic bacteruria data was in _pregnancy_!
- bladder thought to be sterile
    - NOPE!
    - definitely not in cath patients (crazy variety as per Human Microbiome project)
    - but also in uncatheterized patients
- WBC in urine is NOT a good way to distinguish UTI from AsB
- _Tratner et al Am J Infect Control 2014_ found that organism __type__ drives inappropriate Abx use (like overreacting to ESBL eColi)
- _Tratner ICHE 2016_ nursing home survey of nurses regarding culturing
- Other studies showing positive cultures lead to Abx: _Leis ICHE 2015_, _Drekonja ICHE 2014_
- National Database Study:
    - 29% did culture
    - 22% had >1 culture (range 2-__19__)
    - 12% (?) had more than one culture sent q2days
    - culturing lead to >3000 days of extra Abx use (& NOT for urine infections!)
    - may also result in increased length of stay
- "What happens in real life"- funny slide
- "Antibiotic Time Out Interventions" - see slide for good study reference
