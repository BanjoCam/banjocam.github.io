##Vancomycin Lecture##

- meta analysis shows know mortality difference between high and low troughs (except microbiologic)
- possibly not a great surrogate marker
- "We can't get there from here" 2011 only MIC of 0.5 really showed actual hit of the AUC/MIC ratio, not for MIC >1
- You can hit MIC of 1 with 15-20 but not as soon as the MIC is over
- insane variability of AUC with the same trough
- trough is not serving as a good surrogate marker
- Should we instead monitor for AUC?
	- two meta analysis showed it does relate to failure
	- Etest vs BMD, variability in finding AUC
	- Estimatino of AUC from Dose/Clearance of vanco, formula is not that great
- IDSA guidlines don't care about MIC < 2 anyway, change based on pt response
- Chasing troughs is a slow way to get things therapeutic
- one paper looked at aiming higher AUC/MIC for "high risk" based on the _source_ of bacteremia
- new studies shows the ratio you amin for is based on initial bacerial load (For SA)
- troughs important for predicting nephrotoxicity (similar for any trough < 20, around or less than 15%)
	- reversible
- can probably push through and continue with vanco despite new nephrotoxicty (shown by a paper in 2012) to avoid new expensive agents
- AUC/MIC is best if AUC <= 1.5, ranges based on MIC test differences
	- min tox by trough < 20 and AUC<800
- current weight/RF based dose nomograms are not ideal
- Bayesian EStimation of AUC0-24 - uses computer, it works... lots of papers
	- Can simplify with equation based models  
Key points
***
- 24 hr AUC/MIC of 400 do *not* correlate to troughs of 15-20
- can use troughs for nephrotoxicity but AUC may still be better
- two vanco concentrations drawn in the first 24-48 hrs (before steady state) used with Bayesian may be a better dosing method for vancomycin
- This data is strictly representing bacteremia

##Daptomycin Dose Selection; PK/PD Considerations##

- Manufacturer dosing is 4 or 6mg/kg but IDSA recommends 8-10 depending on indication
	- Case studies and cohort studies that long term high dose is well tolerated
	- Concerns about risk of CPK elevation
	-
