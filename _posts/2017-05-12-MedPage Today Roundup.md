Trying out a new post type. I keep track of a few days of interesting links from MedPage Today emails (they have
great summaries!) in a draft post and jot down a few notes for each. Then, when there's a reasonable number of links, I'll
publish the post.

[FDA Okays Antioxidant Drug for ALS](http://www.medpagetoday.com/Neurology/GeneralNeurology/65087?xid=nl_mpt_DHE_2017-05-08&eun=g1123932d0r&pos=11)
- edaravone (Radicava) approved in the US, works to relieve oxidative stress caused by ALS
    - reduces blood vessel and neuron injury
    - leads to reduced decline of daily functioning
    - may only work for mildly symptomatic patients
- has been approved (for brain damage prevention post stroke) since 2002 in Japan
- IV infusion only, risk for allergic reaction, complicated dosing schedule.

[Most Docs Make Wrong Choices in Stopping PPIs](https://www.medpagetoday.com/MeetingCoverage/DDW/65101?xid=nl_mpt_DHE_2017-05-08&eun=g1123932d0r&pos=4)
- Simulation-based survey found that docs would continue PPIs in low risk (bleed) patients but discontinue in high risk patients
- We should be discontinuing PPIs in more low risk patients given that they are not nearly
as innocuous as we once thought
- This makes sense to what I've seen in practice - trying to stop PPIs in patients at risk of _c diff_ recurrence. The hardest part is figuring out why they were on the PPI in the first place!

[AACE: Iron Indices Tied to HbA1c in Poorly Controlled T2D](https://www.medpagetoday.com/mastery-of-medicine/mastery-in-diabetes-management/65100?xid=nl_mpt_DHE_2017-05-08&eun=g1123932d0r&pos=3)
- Not much data yet. Elevated iron indicies (e.g., serum iron & ferritin) are associated to
poorly controlled type two diabetes.

[AACE: GLP-1 Receptor Agonist Successful Tx for T1D](https://www.medpagetoday.com/mastery-of-medicine/mastery-in-diabetes-management/65093?xid=nl_mpt_DHE_2017-05-08&eun=g1123932d0r&pos=0)
- Liraglutide reduced HbA1c by 0.29% vs placebo in type 1 diabetes patients, based on a 
systemic review and meta-analysis
- Also found reduction in insulin dose requirements
- Surpringly fast effect (within 3 months)
> "The group suggested these findings may be attributed to the reduction in post-prandial glucagon surge following appetite suppression induced by liraglutide, due to the lack of functioning beta cells in those with type 1 diabetes."

[Eating Raw Meat Tied to Toxoplasmosis in Japan](https://www.medpagetoday.com/MeetingCoverage/PAS/65128)
- Found that raw meat had a much higher association with toxo in pregnancy than did
scooping cat litter
    - Unfortunately for guys with cats and pregnant wives, the guy should still definitely be scooping the cat litter. But the risk is probably far less than what most people think
- People in the region studies routinely eat raw horse meat and raw chicken meat. UGH

[One in Three Newly Approved Drugs Has Safety Issues](https://www.medpagetoday.com/PublicHealthPolicy/FDAGeneral/65139?xid=nl_mpt_DHE_2017-05-10&eun=g1123932d0r&pos=0)
- Looked at drugs approved between 2001 and 2010, and found 32% had post-market safety issues
- Lead to 3 market removals and 61 black box warnings
- Only so much you can do with the number of participants in clinical trials
- Very important to fill out those Health Canada Vigilance Reports!

[Quinine for Leg Cramps Tied to Increased Death Risk](http://www.medpagetoday.com/Neurology/SleepDisorders/65178?xid=nl_mpt_International_2017-05-12&eun=g1123932d0r)
- Quinine for muscle cramps or restless legs can lead to 3-fold increase
in risk of death... in patients under age 50
    - less risk in older adults
    - higher doses increased risk
- Not that effective to begin with
- Were unable to factor out unmeasured confounders, so it _might_ not be
because of the quinine
- They are also worried about daily consumption of Gin and Tonic. Thankfully no evidence against it though. (one would imagine the alcohol
would be the more concerning part!)
