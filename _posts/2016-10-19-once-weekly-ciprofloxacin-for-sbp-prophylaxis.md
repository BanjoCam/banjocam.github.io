We had a patient today whose med history showed ciprofloxacin 750mg PO weekly for
chronic SBP prophylaxis. Given that the usual standard in guidelines is 500-750mg _daily_,
this was a bit confusing. I found [this study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7557868)
from 1995 which showed efficacy for once weekly dosing. However, [this review](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7557868)
from _Pharmacy and Therapeutics_ mentions it's not preferred due to reduced
efficacy compared to daily, and [this review](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4686472/)
from _Hospital Pharmacy_ cites concern for resistance as a reason against using
weekly. (Intuitively I would think that daily exposure would be worse for
resistance given the ongoing bacterial exposure to drug...) I would therefore
suggest daily unless perhaps there was a concern about tolerance/ADRs. But at
least the med rec seemed to be accurate.

(Was this a post for the sake of making a post? Yes! But I am just trying to
get in the habit of writing more.)
