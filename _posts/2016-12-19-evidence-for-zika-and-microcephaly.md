Not something that will affect my practice but I did find it interesting. I was (incorrectly) under
the impression that we only had a corrollary link with Zika and microcephaly, but we did have a causal
link with Zika, microcephaly, and pregnancy loss. This study looked at presence of Zika in microcephalic
infants and pregnant women and had some scary results (like mean 163 days between maternal symptom onset
and detection in fetal brain!)

The summary I read was [here](http://www.medpagetoday.com/InfectiousDisease/ZikaVirus/62050). Scary stuff.
