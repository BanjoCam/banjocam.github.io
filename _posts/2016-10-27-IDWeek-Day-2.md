Starting here at 7am today... here's my live(ish) notes for the day.

## Maximizing the Electronic Health Record and Clinical Decision Support Systems for Antimicrobial Stewardship ##

- Stewardship teams are supposed to have IT staff on them! who kneww
- Clinical decision support = "Any electronic tool that reduces the cognitive burden of patient care in an electronic health record"
- _read Bates DW et al 2003 - ten commandments for effective clinical decision support: making the practice of evidence-based medicine a reality"_
	- little things can make a big difference; doesn't have to involve complicated decisions and algorithms
	- Make it easy to do the right thing & make it harder to do the wrong thing
- So far a lot of suggestions are around CPOE based solutions, things to keep in mind for *someday*
	- eg remove urine culture from urinalysis "quick menu" entry
	- build sets for indication based abx
		- looks like CPOE leave lots of spots where MD can make an error when ordering a med
		- eg "cipro for simple cystitis" defaults to a preset dose and duration for the right dosage form
		- don't overbuild
