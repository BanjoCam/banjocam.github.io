Starting here at 7am today... here's my live(ish) notes for the day.

## Maximizing the Electronic Health Record and Clinical Decision Support Systems for Antimicrobial Stewardship ##

- Stewardship teams are supposed to have IT staff on them! who kneww
- Clinical decision support = "Any electronic tool that reduces the cognitive burden of patient care in an electronic health record"
- _read Bates DW et al 2003 - ten commandments for effective clinical decision support: making the practice of evidence-based medicine a reality"_
	- little things can make a big difference; doesn't have to involve complicated decisions and algorithms
	- Make it easy to do the right thing & make it harder to do the wrong thing
- So far a lot of suggestions are around CPOE based solutions, things to keep in mind for *someday*
	- eg remove urine culture from urinalysis "quick menu" entry
	- build sets for indication based abx
		- looks like CPOE leave lots of spots where MD can make an error when ordering a med
		- eg "cipro for simple cystitis" defaults to a preset dose and duration for the right dosage form
		- don't overbuild
	- hyperlink to dosing guidelines for complicated drugs (vanco) while ordering
	- you could also build in mandatory ID consults for restricted drugs! CPOE looks great
	- can build in shock box sepsis set right in there with the pathways and whatnot (can do things like have it bypass certain prompts and make sure it's all instantly set as STAT)
- most important factor found in interruptive drug-drug alerts was actually the aesthetic display of the alert
- follow up alerts: can be collected and sent straight to ASP pharmacist. 
	- eg: presumptive pseudomonas found on culture, no abx ordered currently that actually cover it

## Maximizing Electronic Health Record and Clinical Decision Support Systems in Community Hospitals ##

- some CDSS can diagnose adverse drug reactions
- high maintenance associated with building your own CDSS; if you are not keeping them up to date, they get out of usefulness very quickly (for recommendation based ones)
- add indication as as a required element for ordering abx in CPOE
- IV/PO alert: if pt has been given another non PRN PO med, and is ordered an IV abx, will show an alert (suppressed with certain examples)
	- also has pharmacist alerts for drugs that have PO stepdown medical directives for pharmacists
	- issues with suppressive criteria, can't factor things like difficulty swallowing etc; alert fatigue
- integrate recent laxative administration as part of c-diff test alerts
- DRIP score: potential for resistant bacteria in pneumonia. can develop a tool (10 criteria) which can suggest appropriate abx based on potential bugs
	- [this looks to be the original paper on DRIP scores](http://aac.asm.org/content/early/2016/02/02/AAC.03071-15)

## Antibiotic Stewardship - Oral Abstract Session ##

Why is the air conditioning so strong in New Orleans? I wish I brought my winter midlayer

### The Role of Procalcitonin in Guiding Antimicrobial Therapy Duration in Cancer ###

- Procalcitonin is an inflammatory marker which is elevated in bloodstream infections and sepsis. used for guiding abx in RTI and somme other things
- recent Lancet study showed monitoring PCT reduced duration of antimocrobials based on DDD and decreased mortality BUT had possibly increased rate of reinfection
	- excluded immunocompromised patients
	- [what I think is the lancet paper](http://www.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/laninf/PIIS1473-3099(16)00053-0.pdf)
- This paper looked at febrile cancer pts / feb neut without obvious source
- post-hoc analysis
- short vs long abx groups (<= 7 days), similar group characteristics but the long group had a lot more people (77 vs 44)
- conc: in feb cancer pts with lower baseline PCT or a decrease of 80% from baseline, a short IV abx duration has the same outcome as a longer course
- _I should read up on procalcitonin, but I am not sure we can even order it yet in Canada?_

### Increased Risk of Sepsis during Hospital Readmission Following Exposure to Certain Antibiotics during Hospitalization ###

- looked at risk based on what abx were received during previous stay
- retrospective cohort study
- divided abx by potential risk of gut microbiota disruption
	- high = 3/4th gen ceph, FQ, lincosamide, BL/BLase, PO vanco, carbepenem
	- low = 1/2nd gen, macrolide, tetracycline
	- get the rest from the slides
- control group had no abx during previous stay
- high risk had statistically significant Odds ratio, but low risk didn't
- significant association with abx exposure and post-discharge sepsis within 90 days
- a good selling point for aggressive antimicrobial stewardship
- many confounding factors in the study because of the huge variety of comorbidities and very sick population, can't make the association with abx since the other factors could play more into the post-discharge sepsis

### Use of an Epic-Enabled Antimicrobial Stewardship Analytics Platform to Benchmark Suboptimal Restricted Antimicrobial Use Within an Academic Hospital ###

- IDSA prefers DOT vs DDD but the evidence is weak
- Stanford has 15 restricted ABX including fosfomycin
- When order is placed, triggers alert in Epic for ASP review. If empiric, alert is then pushed to 72 hours later
- Epic has a stewardship module
- DOT doesn't tier by "inappropriate DOT" so this paper looked at developing ways to do that
- to separate inappropriate DOT, it's resource intensive -> requires access to patient-level data
- Not sure how to apply this to practice
	- I think the point is that ASP team showed an overall DOT decrease of like 20-something%, but if you just look at decrease in inappropriate DOTs, the decrease is more like 40-something %
- developed detailed questions system to determine "inappropriate"

### Durability of Benefits of Behavioural Interventions on Inappropriate Antibiotic Prescribing in Primary Care: Followup from a Cluster Randomized Clinical Trial ###

- 10% of all abumulatory visits are for Acute Resp Infections; 44% of all abx are for these, 50% of which are inappropriate
- 3 interventions
	- suggested alternatives: CPOE popup for indication for abx, and if pick a non-bacterial indication, get a bunch of non-abx suggestions for different tx
	- accountable justification: instead of alternatives, got asked to put in a "tweet-length" text justification for why they are prescribing the abx. Also made it clear that these justifications are going to go into the actual chart
	- peer comparison: if you are in 10% least inappropriate rxs, you get a monthly email saying you are a "top perfomer". If you were really bad, you get a monthly email saying "you are NOT a top performer"
- followed the results of intervnetions active for 18 months, then again 18 months after they were deactivated
- interventions were successful while active, got worse after stopping but not as bad as baseline

### Impact of Antimicrobial Stewardship and Rapid Microarray Testing on Patients with Gram-Negative Bacteremia ###

- Gram positive and gram negative platform, gram negative can detect 8 species; run immediately after gram stain and get immediate info on 8 different organisms AND several resistance markers
- can't be performed on polymicrobial gram stains -> unreliable results
- At this institution paired results initially with an ASP pharmacist page with results
- Some physician hesitation to deescalate based on rapid test alone
- Reduced overall hospital stay duration

### An Evaluation of Antibiotic Prescribing Practices Upon Hospital Discharge ###

- up to half of abx prescribed at discharge are inappropriate
- reviewed 150 discharge abx rx for appropriateness (indication, duration, spectrum, dose & frequency)
- most common indication was "no infection" - 22%
	- prolonged surgical prophylaxis
	- previous neutropenia but no longer neutropenic on discharge
- a few had duration too short, but a lot had duration too long
- inappropraite indication + inappropriate duration = 76% of inappropriate prescriptions
