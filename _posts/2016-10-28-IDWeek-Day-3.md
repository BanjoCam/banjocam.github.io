## IDSA/SHEA Guidelines: Implementing an Antibiotic Stewardship Program ##

- learning "how the sausage was made"
- newer IDSA guidelines use the "GRADE" system to rank suggestions, factors in more than just evidence quality (old system)
- new guidelines no longer prefer prospective audit and feedback over preauthorization
	- restrictive prescribing worked better and faster but strategies become equivalent at 12 mo
	- switching preauth to PAF showed inreased DOT and length of stay
	- PAF only has an impact if implemented in an existing ASP
	- comparison table available in the guidelines
	- TL;DR: implement one or both and keep doing it consistently
- syndrome -specific: new guidelines emphasize the benefit of this approach (eg SSTI, CAP, asymptomatic bacteruria)
- rapid testing in micro lab has no ASP benefit unless the ASP team is directly involved in real time
	- results will just sit there without ASP intervening
- limited study for procalcitonin; may not even do that much
- DDDs are less good than DOTs but way easier to calculate
	- DOT are not consistent in q2d dosing
- antibiotic costs ideally measured based on rx or actual administrations rather than by purchasing data and normalized by patient census
- cost savings wane as asp continues so measure what costs would be if you didn't have a stewardshiop program
	- apparently there are **metrics and guidelines available** to calculate what costs would be without a stewardship program. F/U!!

## Impact of Clinical Practice Guidelines on Antimicrobial Stewardship ##

- Value = (Quality + Service) / Cost
	- service relates to patient perspective
- HICPAC: ASP workshop, july 2016 - guidelines are helpful for defining abx use but have not routinely incorporated stewardship principles
- Guidelines don't factor in cost effectiveness
- wholesale prices of abx in the states are crazy (dapto like $500/day?)
- issues with restricted drugs being cheaper than non-restricted (like linezolid vs vanco)
- Wachter et al. public reporting of antibiotic timing in patients with pneumonial ann intern med 2008
	- focus on patients interests above all else
- 1 hour rule in sepsis has become the 3 hour rule as of 2015
- **HAP/VAP guidelines 2016**: only include MRSA drug in pts with risk factor for MRSA infection or at high risk for mortality
	- only in pts with an increased likelyhood of pseudomonas/resistant GNR do you need an antipseudomonal
	- a good stewardship-based guideline

## Impact of Core Measures on Antimicrobial Stewardship Programs ##

- measures come from NQF (National Quality Forum), non profit organization
- SCIP - surgical care improvement project
	- retired now due to great compliance... except for the 24 hrs stop recommendation
- the CAP measures have a very confusing pseudomonas section, taken out of guidelines but should not be included as a core measure
	- beta-lactam + FQ for ICU CAP is probably excessive and unnecessary
- sepsis: recent meta analysis did not find an association with antibiotic timing and increased mortality in severe sepsis and septic shock
	- all retrospective studies
	- Kumar study 2006 (study where most of our guidelines come from) is actually an outlier in the meta-analysis
	- CMS has put out new release notes commenting on pts with sepsis with known pathogen or with c diff
		- jointcommission.org
		- also have de-escalation release notes that came out a few days ago 

## Who Really Needs Antimicrobials? Rapid Diagnostics & BioMarkers ##

-  pathogen specific tests: hard to tell colonizers, test site inaccessible/unknown, etc
- biomarkers: no info on etiology, can tell if infection is present, can't generalize to special populations
- current rapid tests: GAS, influenza
	- quicker resp panels
	- limited biomarkers: procalcitonin, urinalysis
	- more robust biomarker panels in the works
- point of care pathogen tests: molecular tests coming with excellent sensitive and specificity (even compared to PCR) 
- currently available CLIA-waived molecular tests:
	- Alere i inflenza A&B, Roche Cobas Liat influenza A/B
	- 15-20 min, roche 99.2% sensitive and 100% specific vs Simplexa PCR
	- will people still rx Abx "just in case"
- POC tests have risks of contamination, huge user manual with checklist to mitigate risk. Will be a challenge
- New direct from blood pathogen test T2
	- works like a tiny MRI for bacteria, works on magnetic fields
	- Covers top 6 bacteria; SA, E faecium, ecoli, kleb, pseudo, acintobacter; still missing a lot
	- No info on susc so may not be super useful for ASP
- Forthcoming tests:
	- DNAe: similar to T2 but will give some sus data
	- Qvella FAST ID BSI panel: 15 species/genus pathogens in blood, 96% sens and 99% spec. 45 minutes from blood draw
- Biomarkers - what's available today
	- c reactive protein, ESR, lactate, urinalysis, procalcitonin (show host response)
	- some others exist for showing presence of microorganisms
	- procalcitonin: secretion starts 4 hrs post stimulus, peaks at 32 hrs. produced by tissues during infection
		- nonspecific and can be affected by other conditions
		- may help with differentiating bacterial vs viral and duration of abx

## The Third Leg of the Antimicrobial Stewardship Stool - Laboratory Diagnostics and Antimicrobial Stewardship ##

##### (huh?) #####

- Randomized Trial of Rapid Multiplex PCR - based Blood Culture Indetification and Suceptibility Testing
	- 2015 Clin Infect Dis (Banerjee R et al)
	- Proescptive RCT; grp 1 (Control) = standard BC processing; grp 2 = rapid multiplex PCR with templated comments; grp 3 = grp 1 + grp 2 process + stewardship intervention
		- ID physician or pharmacist paged with the result 24/7
		- 3 groups were similar, about 200 people each
		- stewardship group had the best results in terms of deescalation - seemed to be an independent effect with ASP
- Langford BJ et al _J clin microbiol_ toronto 2016
	- suppressed cipro reporting on enterobacterecia when other things were sensitive
	- showed a steep decline in cipro use over time (statistically significant)
	- non statistically significant possible rise in cirpo Sus for ecoli and pseudo
- epstein et al _infect control hosp epidemiol_ 2016
- Sarg et al _infect control hosp episdemiol_ 2016
	- studies looking to try and reduce unnecessary uine cultures in ICU
	- screening proceudre to precede urine culturing will reduce lab testing
