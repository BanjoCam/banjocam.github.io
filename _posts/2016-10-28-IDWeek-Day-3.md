## IDSA/SHEA Guidelines: Implementing an Antibioti Stewardship Program ##

- learning "how the sausage was made"
- newer IDSA guidelines use the "GRADE" system to rank suggestions, factors in more than just evidence quality (old system)
- new guidelines no longer prefer prospective audit and feedback over preauthorization
	- restrictive prescribing worked better and faster but strategies become equivalent at 12 mo
	- switching preauth to PAF showed inreased DOT and length of stay
	- PAF only has an impact if implemented in an existing ASP
	- comparison table available in the guidelines
	- TL;DR: implement one or both and keep doing it consistently
- syndrome -specific: new guidelines emphasize the benefit of this approach (eg SSTI, CAP, asymptomatic bacteruria)
- rapid testing in micro lab has no ASP benefit unless the ASP team is directly involved in real time
	- results will just sit there without ASP intervening
- limited study for procalcitonin; may not even do that much
- DDDs are less good than DOTs but way easier to calculate
	- DOT are not consistent in q2d dosing
- antibiotic costs ideally measured based on rx or actual administrations rather than by purchasing data and normalized by patient census
- cost savings wane as asp continues so measure what costs would be if you didn't have a stewardshiop program
	- apparently there are **metrics and guidelines available** to calculate what costs would be without a stewardship program. F/U!!

## Impact of Clinical PRactice Guidelines on Antimicrobial Stewardship ##

- Value = (Quality + Service) / Cost
	- service relates to patient perspective
- HICPAC: ASP workshop, july 2016 - guidelines are helpful for defining abx use but have not routinely incorporated stewardship principles
- Guidelines don't factor in cost effectiveness
- wholesale prices of abx in the states are crazy (dapto like $500/day?)
- issues with restricted drugs being cheaper than non-restricted (like linezolid vs vanco)
- Wachter et al. public reporting of antibiotic timing in patients with pneumonial ann intern med 2008
	- focus on patients interests above all else
- 1 hour rule in sepsis has become the 3 hour rule as of 2015
- **HAP/VAP guidelines 2016**: only include MRSA drug in pts with risk factor for MRSA infectino or at high risk for mortality
	- only in pts with an increased likelyhood of pseudomonas/resistant GNR do you need an antipseudomonal
	- a good stewardship-based guideline
