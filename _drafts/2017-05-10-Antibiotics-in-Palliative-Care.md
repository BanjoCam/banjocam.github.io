The issue comes up a lot lately on Stewardship rounds regarding antibiotics in palliative/"comfort-only" care. Often we see 
orders like "discontinue all medications, except IV antibiotics". This is often a difficult and controversial
topic with very little evidence behind it. There main arguments in favour of keeping antibiotics are for
non life-threatining infections, where the infection will not shorten lifespan, but treating will help 
as a symptom management. This argument is backed, for example, by this paper: [Antibiotic Treatment in End-of-Life Cancer Patientsâ€”A Retrospective Observational Study at a Palliative Care Center in Sweden](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5040986/) (_cancers_, 2016). Here they found that antibiotics helped
symptoms in 37% of patients, and had minimal adverse events. The discussion section of the paper also has
an excellent literature review showing many papers that agree _and_ ones that disagree.  

This paper is a bit older, and looks more at longer term palliation. [Survival and Comfort After Treatment of Pneumonia in Advanced Dementia](http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/225757) (_JAMA, 2010_). In this
patient population, when treating pneumonia, comfort scores __decreased__ as intensity of therapy
__increased__ (i.e., no therapy -> PO antibiotics -> Parenteral Antibiotics). The reasons behind the decrease
in comfort could not be validated (dementia patients), but were thought to be due to ADRs and the 
invaseness of injectable formulations.  

Overall, nothing conclusive enough to sway the decision in either direction. Unfortunately, the papers
in favour of palliative Abx do not look at the situation from a Stewardship mindset; yes, the individual
patients did not experience many adverse events, but there may be overall impact on hospital antibiogram
and resistance patterns for other patients. In practice, the biggest factor we find in decision making
tends to be the patient's family looking for one last shred of hope... meaning that most of the pros
and cons discussed in these papers tend to be irrelevant anyway.
