Montreal trial

- retrospective chart review at Sherbrooke hospital 
- defined as positive c diff assay or evidence of pseudomembranous colitis
- complicated: megacolon, perforation, colectomy, shock requiring vasopressor therapy, or death within 30 days
- # cases in creased from 35.6/100000 to 156.3 (1991-2003)
    - 866.5/100000 in 65 y/o + (10-fold inrease)
- complicated cases increased and so did mortality
- most adverse outcomes: WBC 20 or greater & creat 200 or greater
    - in 2003, 45/110 of pts with these values had complicated c diff, and 28 died (41% and 25.5% vs 12% and 11%)
        - 87/110 were given metronidazole, 34 of them progressed to complicated and 20 died. Only 2/110 were given vanco. (what did the remainder get??)
    - 25% chance of developing complicated; 19% chance of death (vs 6% and 4.2%)
    
- vanco pts had 79% less progression to complicated CDAD

- toxin B cytoassay
>> The independent factors associ- ated with complicated CDAD were age of 65 years or more, hospital-acquired CDAD, tube feeding in the 2 months preceding diagnosis, not having had surgery in the 2 months preceding diagnosis, immunosuppression, a peak leukocyte count of 20.0 Ã— 109/L or greater and renal failure.
- flagyl may have not been better than no treatment??
    - in the context of progression to complicated CDAD
- worst abx contributors: macrolides, 2-3rd gen cephs, clinda, quinolones
    - macrolides given with cephs so may not be their fault
    - no difference between narrow spectrum pens & beta lactam inhibitor combos
- theories to increase: increasing mean age of patients (= comorbidities, poor immune response, more frequent need for antibiotics)
    - poor investment in hospitals in Quebece = poor hygienic conditions => more transmission 

>>Leukocytosis and a high creatinine level were strong and independent factors associated with an increased risk of complicated CDAD. This may have been because they re- flect different processes, the former being a marker of se- vere colon inflammation and the latter, the severity of diar- rhea.

## A Comparison of Vanco and Flagyl, Stratified by Disease Severity ##

- prospective randomized double linded placebo controlled trial to compare the two agents, stratified to either mild or severe disease
- flagyl 250 mg QID vs vanco 125mg QID, either for 10 days. both groups received placebo too. 
- followed up 21 days after
- between 1994-2002
- 172 enrolled pts with 150 completed. 
- in mild, flagyl cured 90%, vanco 98%
    - severe: flagyl 76%, vanco 97%
- recurrence: 15% flagyl, 14% vanco
    - 14% flagyl recurrence after initial cure vs 7% with vanco
- 15-25% of all AAD is CDAD ...?
- single center, university of illinois at Chicago (200 bed, acute care teaching hospital)
- diarrhea = 3 ore more nonformed stools in 24 hrs. c diff was toxin A or pseudomembranous colitis
- excluded life-threatening intra abdominal complications, like perforated viscus or bowel obstruction; prior failure of CDAD to respond to either study drug; pregnancyl hx of allergy to either drug; or __treatment with PO vanco or flagyl within the last 14 days__
- severity was defined by any __two more more__ of the following: age >= 60, temp > 38.3, albumin  >2.5 mg/dL, or WBC > 15
    - pseudomembranous colitis or __treatment in the ICU__ were instantly severe
- did repeat c diff tests on days 6, 10, and 21 (if there was still diarrhea). ... why?
- cure was defined as resolution of diarrhea by day 6 AND a negative c diff at days 6 and 10
- failure was opposite of cure, or the need for colectomy, or death after 5 days of therapy
- <40% of patients in severe group received abx within 14 days prior
- only 1 adr in each group (flagyl emesis, vanco nausea)
- hilarious, one study had "acquisition during the spring" as a severity risk factor
- vancomycin has the "potential to increase the prevalnce of vanco resistant organisms"
    - low incidence of complications when vanco is used as initial therapy
- NAP1 strain have altered tcdC gene -> modifies TcdC proteint that is a negative regulator of toxin A & B production => toxin levels 16-23 fold greater than wild type, more severe disease, and increased number of relapses, and occurance of disease in previously uncommon populations __(outpts, peripartium women, children, and people who never received abx)__
- didn't perform culture and sus for flagyl for c diff, but didn't think resistance to flagyl was the reason for treatment failure
    - longstanding known flagyl resistance, that HASN'T increase, but flagyl treatment failures HAVE been increasing
    - also should have affected both mild and severe groups equally
    - theory: drug is delivered from bloodstream thru inflamed colonic mucosa; stool concentrations decrease as disease resolves. Therefore, theorize that severe disease = decreased blood flow to the colon and therefore deliver lesss metronidazole to the mucosa and colonic lumen
