Just been catching up with Dr. Mark Crislip's Puscast. Checked out a few of the references he linked to in the most recent one. Not really a reference I suppose, but there is a really interesting read about the history of Penicillin and other antibiotics. Many details you don't usually hear about. I especially liked their conclusion, basically "look how much work goes into making an antibiotic... now stop wasting them!"
