- new study suggesting all NSAIDs have equal risk when used in pts with CV disease
    - only looked at celebrex 200mg total daily dose
    - traditionally naproxen is supposed to be the safest in CV disease, up to 500mg BID
    - celebrex still preferred if GI risk factors (even in concurrent CV disease)

- pts on chronic suboxone, if also have pain issues (and non-opioid adjuncts not helping), 
you can divide the suboxone dose out to q6-8h to improve its analgesic effects

- new Canadian guidelines for prevnar/pneumovax in >65 y/o... give both, prevnar first is better.
    - See guidelines for timelines depending on when/what is given first, etc
    - Prevnar not covered unless immunocompromise, may change

- give Tdap to pregnant moms after week 26. This is being done in the US but not in Canada yet
    - transfers immunity to the fetus. 
    - many cases of pertussi (whooping cough) in newborns, but they don't get tdap until week 8

- calcium supps + CV risk may be overblown; stay less than recommended daily max
    - 1g a day  for women <=50, men <=70, 1200mg otherwise
    - max 2500 < 50y/o, 2000mg <50
    - ca supps likely don't cause dementia

- quinolones in kids: no joint damage or tendon rupture actually observed. (original data was in beagels)
    - may still cause joint or muscle pain

- beta-blockers & PPIs should be tapered to stop safely (eg in palliation)

- biologics can have "biosimilars" - not a generic version, but should work the same
    - infliximab already has one (Inflectra)
    - now etanercept has one (Brenzys) -> $200 less /month but doesn't have all the indications
        - no washout needed to switch and dosing is the same
