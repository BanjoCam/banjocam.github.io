<hr>

__DISCLAIMER__: Any opinions expressed on this site are my own; they do not
represent that of my colleagues or employer.

I am a full time clinical pharmacist, informally specializing in
Infectious Diseases, and head of my hospital's Antimicrobial Stewardship
Program (ASP). When I'm not stamping out unnecessary antibiotic use, I enjoy
hobby computer programming, generally for pharmacy/hospital related
applications.

I've started this medical literature blog for the following reasons:

- To create an organized and searchable repository of my thoughts on references
and articles I've read
- To act as my my College-required Continuing Improvement Portfolio
- To motivate myself to more _regularly_ keep up with literature, instead of in
giant occasional boluses

If anyone happens to stumble upon this and find it useful, that's just bonus! Please note that I am by no means an expert in clinical appraisal, and
my interprations may not always be "correct". The comments just represent my
overall thoughts and feelings, and how I would apply the literature to
practice.... so that I can look back later and reflect.
